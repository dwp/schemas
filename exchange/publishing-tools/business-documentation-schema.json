This service uses the National Insurance Number (or NINO) to identify the citizens and supply an amount of benefit as the sum of all benefits awarded. You can specify the time period and customise the output accordingly. The service was created to allow DWP, and our citizen-facing users, to easily verify the amount of benefits awarded to a citizen. This allows us to keep this data in one secure place, rather than in, for example, spreadsheets where it might get lost and/or modified incorrectly."

These are a few examples, and there will be many more ways you might choose to use the Award Details API service."
